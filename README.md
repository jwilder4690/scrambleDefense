# Scramble Defense

This was my submission for a 48 hour Game Jam. It is a text/puzzle game where you attempt to unscramble the word bombs falling to diffuse them before they hit your city. I am quite happy with what I was able to complete in that time frame. 

scrambleDefense.pde is the runnable code if you have Processing 
scrambleDefense.zip holds the self contained application for windows 64-bit
